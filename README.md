# DB2LinqPadDriver
LINQPad driver for connecting to a DB2 database.

I'm creating the data context class hierarchy semi-manually through the DataContextCodeGenerator class.  I could probably make the querying faster if I created a smarter set of classes here.  This seems to work pretty well overall though.

In LINQPad, import DB2DataContextDriver.lpx.
